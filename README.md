# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) API Server with FastAPI


Detailed Project Description:

This project is a simple, yet powerful API server designed to perform document search and retrieval using a technology called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Built using FastAPI (a modern web framework for building APIs), this server can accept different types of document files, process them, and allow users to search for relevant content within these documents.



What Does This Project Do?

Ingest (Store) Documents for Searching:

This server accepts various document formats like PDF, DOC, DOCX, and TXT.
Users can upload documents, which the server processes and stores in a way that makes them easy to search and retrieve later.
Convert Text to Vector Embeddings for Search:

To understand the content of the documents, the server transforms each document into something called a vector embedding.
Think of vector embeddings as a way to capture the "meaning" of each document in numbers so that the server can find similar documents based on content, not just exact words.
It uses an AI model called sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (from Hugging Face) to create these vector embeddings. This model is efficient and works well on standard CPUs, meaning it doesn’t need specialized hardware.
Store Embeddings Using ChromaDB for Fast Retrieval:

Once the document is transformed into an embedding, it’s stored in a database called ChromaDB.
ChromaDB is a special type of database designed to handle vector embeddings, making it faster to find relevant documents when a user makes a query (search request).
The database is set up to save the embeddings even if the server is restarted, so the data remains persistent (saved) over time.

Non-Blocking and Fast API Requests:

The server is designed with FastAPI, which allows it to handle multiple user requests at the same time without blocking others. This is called asynchronous or non-blocking behavior.
Users can upload documents, search for information, and get results quickly, even if many people are using the system simultaneously.

Who Is This Project For?
Developers and Data Scientists: People building applications where users need to search for information across multiple documents can use this API as a foundational service.
Businesses and Organizations: Companies needing a tool to store and search their documents, such as customer support logs, legal documents, or research papers.
Students and Researchers: This is a great tool for learning about RAG, document search, and how to work with vector embeddings.

How Does It Work? (Step-by-Step)
Document Ingestion:

A user uploads a document (PDF, DOC, DOCX, or TXT) to the server.
The server reads the document’s content and extracts the text.
Vector Embedding Creation:

Once the document’s text is extracted, the server uses the sentence-transformers model to create a vector embedding.
This embedding is a mathematical representation of the text, capturing the main ideas and meaning.
Storage in ChromaDB:

The embedding (along with the document’s original content and filename) is stored in ChromaDB.
ChromaDB acts as a vector store that can quickly find relevant embeddings when a search is made.
Querying Documents:

When a user wants to search for something (e.g., “best practices in data security”), they send a query to the server.
The server converts the query into a vector embedding and searches ChromaDB for similar document embeddings.
The most relevant results are returned to the user, allowing them to see the documents that match their search.

Example Scenario
Imagine a team at a company that needs to keep track of important policies and best practices. They have hundreds of documents saved, but finding the right one every time is a challenge.

Upload: The team uploads each document to the RAG server. The server stores each document as an embedding in ChromaDB.
Search: When a team member wants to find the document related to "data privacy policies," they enter this as a query.
Retrieve: The server finds the most relevant documents related to "data privacy policies" and shows them to the user. This saves time and allows them to get relevant information quickly without searching through each document manually.
Key Benefits
Speed: The FastAPI framework and vector embeddings make document retrieval fast and efficient.
Relevance: Since the server uses embeddings (not just exact keyword matches), it can find documents that match the intent of the search query.
Persistence: ChromaDB saves all the processed embeddings, ensuring that data remains available even if the server restarts.
Simplicity: Users don’t need to know technical details; they can simply upload documents and search for information when needed.

Summary:

This RAG API server project is a powerful solution for those who need to store and retrieve information from large collections of documents. With FastAPI for efficiency, ChromaDB for fast and persistent storage, and sentence-transformers for meaningful search results, this server is designed to be both lightweight and effective. It’s ideal for businesses, researchers, and developers looking to implement a simple, intuitive, and robust document search solution.
